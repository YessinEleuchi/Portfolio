title: How HCI Improved TejFlow’s UI?
description: "A short personal note about how basic HCI and ergonomics principles ended up shaping the UI of TejFlow more than I expected."

Lately I’ve been thinking about something I didn’t expect when I started building TejFlow:
the improvements my clients appreciated the most weren’t the complex features behind the scenes…  
They were the small details that made the interface easier, clearer, and more comfortable to use.

This is a small reminder of how fundamental ideas from human-computer interaction quietly shaped TejFlow’s interface, even when I wasn’t consciously thinking about them.

## 📝 A Quiet Realisation

Somewhere between implementing certificate classification and handling TEJ downtime errors, I started noticing a pattern:

 **- Whenever I respected an HCI principle, users stopped asking questions.**  
 **- Whenever I ignored one, they immediately got confused.**

It became obvious that “just make the UI clear” is not enough.  
Clarity is *designed*, not improvised.

## 🎛 The Little Things That Changed Everything

### **Compatibility**
Using accountants' own vocabulary instead of technical jargon made the interface instantly less intimidating.

### **Homogeneity**
Keeping layouts, buttons, and text patterns consistent across all screens reduced the “Where am I?” moments.

### **Guidance**
A breadcrumb here, a highlighted section there, and suddenly people knew exactly what they were doing.

### **Error Management**
A helpful message with context (“please sync this client to TEJ first”) felt 100× better than a cryptic exception.

These came straight from AFNOR and ISO rules — and yet they felt like common sense once I applied them.

## 🧭 A Note to Myself

If TejFlow feels clean today, it's not because the UI is “pretty”.  
It's because it's **ergonomic**, and ergonomics follow rules:

- humans have limited memory
- humans need immediate feedback
- humans rely on consistency
- humans trust interfaces that guide instead of surprise them

None of this is new… but it’s easy to forget when you’re deep in backend logic.

## ✅ Final Thought

This note is mostly a reminder for future me:

> *Good UI happens when you design for humans, not for screens.*

TejFlow improved not because I added more features,  
but because I started respecting the small principles that make interfaces humane.

Sometimes the most technical projects are shaped by the most human details.
